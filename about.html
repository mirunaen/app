        <p>John Mayer an American singer-songwriter, guitarist, and record producer.
            Born in Bridgeport, Connecticut, Mayer attended Berklee College
            of Music in Boston, but disenrolled and moved to Atlanta in 1997
            with Clay Cook. Together, they formed a short-lived two-man band
            called Lo-Fi Masters. After their split, Mayer continued to play
            local clubs, refining his skills and gaining a following. After
            his appearance at the 2001 South by Southwest Festival, he was
            signed to Aware Records, and then Columbia Records, which released
            his first EP, Inside Wants Out. His following two full-length
            albums—Room for Squares (2001) and Heavier Things (2003)—did well
            commercially, achieving multi-platinum status. In 2003, he won the
            Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for the single
            "Your Body Is a Wonderland".</p>
        <p>Mayer's secondary career pursuits extend to television hosting, comedy, and writing;
            he has authored columns for magazines such as Esquire. He supports various causes
            and has performed at charity benefits. He is a watch aficionado (with a collection
            he values in the "tens of millions" of dollars), contributing to the watch site Hodinkee,
            and has been on the jury at the Grand Prix d'Horlogerie de Genève.</p>
